# Social Media Application

The goal of this class project is to build a social media app prototype for IOS that allows its users to interact with each other on a global home feed. The idea is that registration to the app is restricted to people of a specific community with a corporate email address such as George Washington University students (@gwu.edu). In addition, unlike other popular social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, users need to enter a username instead of their full names for anonymity. Core functionalities include user registration, log-in, sending posts, and accessing global feed through Firebase Authentication and Realtime Database. Other functionalities only mimicked due to time constraints are in-app messaging and searching. Firebase Realtime DB, Firebase Authentication module and identifying files in the project directory as well as dependency installation through CocoaPods are required for deployment.
