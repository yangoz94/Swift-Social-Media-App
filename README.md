# Social Media Application

*This project has been developed as a part of a final class project. While it includes core functionalities, certain functionalities such as in-app messaging and searching have been only mimiced, not implemented due to time limitation and being far beyond the scope of the course.

The app communicates with Firebase Realtime Database and uses Firebase Authentication. However, you need to set up a firebase realtime database, copy the identifying google file to your project directory and follow the remaining steps on firebase official documentation for IOS.
